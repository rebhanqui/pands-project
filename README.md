### Investigating Fisher's Iris Data Set
The Iris Data Project is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, where each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples are equally distributed among three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This dataset is often used for classification tasks in machine learning.
